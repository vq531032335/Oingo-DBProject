You are hired by a startup company to help build the database backend for a new mobile app named oingo that allows users to share useful information via their mobile devices based on social, geographic, temporal, and keyword constraints. Of
course, oingo borrows ideas from many existing applications such as Foursquare, Twitter, Facebook, etc. The main idea in oingo is that users can publish information in the form of short notes, and then link these notes to certain locations and
certain times. Other users can then receive these notes based on their own location, the current time, and based on what type of messages they want to receive.
